# Pota-Lang

Pota Lang is a toy language that was created in just 48 hours! It's written in Python and boasts an easy-to-use syntax reminiscent of Python or Kotlin, yet it's as fast as C++ or Golanh. This speed is achieved through the compiler, which translates the code into C++ ( GoLang version coming soon).

What's remarkable is that the entire compiler fits into just one file, at least for now. This compiler is ready to use on any platform. (Windows, Mac, Linux)

**Note**: This language is still under active development.

> **Usage:**  
To run a Pota Lang file, use: `pota <filename>.pota`
