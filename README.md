# Pota-Lang

Pota lang is a toy language that was made in 48 hours!
It was written in Python programming language. Pota Lang has an easy syntax like Python or Kotlin,
but is as fast as C++!

This is because compiler translates the code into C++ code.

I was able to fit this whole compiler in one file, for now.

Pota Lang is only available for windows but I will be making other verions for it

This is language is still under development.
Usage:
'''pota <filename>.pota'''
